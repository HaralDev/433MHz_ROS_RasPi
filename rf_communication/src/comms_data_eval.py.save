# Setup a dictionary to post messages in:
"""
more elaborate way of logging all the messages could be:
clover_message_dict = {

    # Schematic
    <msg number>: {
        time:     <epoch time>,
        raw_msg:  <raw message string>,
        msg:      <only the message>,
        msg_nr:   <number of the message>,
        hash:     <hash of the message>,
        clover_nr:<nr of the clover>
    }
    
    # Example
    1 : {
        time:     125739481,
        raw_msg:  "1138574",
        msg:      "8574",
        msg_nr:   1,
        hash:     3,
        clover_nr:1
    }
}

And then to loop over the msg in each of the msg_numbers, to construct the message.

For a simple evaluation we will use:

clover_message_dict = {
    <msg>:  {
        received_nr : <number of times received since deletion>,
        genesis: <first msg added>
